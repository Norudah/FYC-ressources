# FYC-Resources

This is the resources folder for the FYC project.  
Warning: all content is written in French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· only.

## What is it?

FYC stands for "Find Your Course."  
Itâ€™s a French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· project designed to replace the traditional final essay for the last year of the ESGI Masterâ€™s degree.

Instead of writing dozens of pages on a topic, we were given a different challenge: creating a course!

Our topic is:  
"How to apply functional programming with JavaScript."

We:

- Wrote more than 80 pages on the subject (extracted from a Google Doc, although it was mainly intended to be hosted on the Moodle platform)
- Created 3 exercises hosted on GitHub to challenge yourself
- Included all code examples from the course as individual files so you can test and explore them hands-on
- Designed 4 multiple-choice quizzes + 1 final test (Moodle-specific)
- Recorded 3 videos with live coding corrections of the exercises
- Recorded 4 videos with test corrections and additional insights beyond simple explanations

## Where to start?

### Document

If you're discovering this course, start by downloading the PDF using the link below:

[Link to the course](https://github.com/Norudah/FYC-ressources/blob/main/Cours%20-%20Introduction%20a%CC%80%20la%20programmation%20fonctionnelle%20en%20javascript.pdf)

### Resources

All code examples from the PDF are extracted in the `/ressources` folder.  
Theyâ€™re organized into subfolders matching each chapter title, so you can explore and practice at your own pace.

### Exercises

Exercises are located in the `/exercices` folder.  
Each subfolder contains a description of the exercise. You can try solving it on your own inside the `/{exerciseName}/exercise` subfolder, then check the solution in the `/{exerciseName}/correction` subfolder.

### Videos

There are 2 videos available for each exercise:

- A presentation of the exercise
- A live coding correction

Hosted on YouTube:

Exercises:
- [Exercise - "Compose"](https://youtu.be/aBKKF4WnSg4)
- [Exercise - "Curry"](https://youtu.be/MS37uepDr4E)
- [Exercise - "Monad Writter"](https://youtu.be/IL_T2r2vypw)

Exercise Corrections:

## Contributing (course staff only)

Resources organization rules:

- Follow the project structure
- Respect file types and organize them into appropriate folders
  - All `.js` files must be placed at the root of each chapter folder
  - Other files (e.g. `.png` images) should go into a `/screenshots` subfolder. You may further separate them into `/screenshots/` and `/schemas/` if needed.
